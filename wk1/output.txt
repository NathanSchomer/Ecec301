1/2 + 1/2 = 1
1/2 + 2/3 = 7/6
3/7 + 5 = 38/7

1/2 == 1/2 is True
1/2 == 2/3 is False

1/2 < 1/2 is False
1/2 < 2/3 is True
2/3 < 1/2 is False

1/2 != 1/2 is False
1/2 != 2/3 is True

1/2 <= 1/2 is True
1/2 <= 2/3 is True
2/3 <= 1/2 is False

1/2 > 1/2 is False
1/2 > 2/3 is False
2/3 > 1/2 is True

1/2 >= 1/2 is True
1/2 >= 2/3 is False
2/3 >= 1/2 is True

Cast 1/2 to float: 0.5
Cast 2/3 to float: 0.666666666667
